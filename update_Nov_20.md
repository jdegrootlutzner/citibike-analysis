# Update November 20th

### Have you already collected, or do you have access to, all of the data that you will need in order to complete your project? If not, please estimate the percentage of the data that you have, describe any issues that you are having, and what your plan is for getting the rest of the data.

Yes, we have access to 100% of the data we need for the project. The R weatherPackage is no longer working but we found weather data [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml?network=NY_ASOS#) and the citiBikes data is [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).

### What is the single biggest unresolved issue you are having? Please describe it briefly, and what your plan is for resolving this issue.

We will need to learn how to deal with the large size of the data. We will be working with Jo on how to deal with storing and accessing the data through a Pomona server. 

### What are the elements from outside of the course, if any, that you plan to incorporate into your project?

We plan to work with Big Data and may talk to CMC professor Mariam Solloum for help. Understanding, visualizing, and modeling a large data set will be the bulk of our outside work. We will work with Shiny as well.
